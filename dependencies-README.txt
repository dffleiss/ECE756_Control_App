The following MATLAB addons need to be installed:

Simulink Desktop Real-Time
    - once installed, run "sldrtkernel -install" in the console
Aerospace Toolbox
Robotics System Toolbox
Instrument Control Toolbox
DSP System Toolbox
Computer Vision Toolbox
Simulink 3D Animation
Parallel Computing Toolbox

Track image should be 9599x7199 pixels at 50dpi
To change the track, change the map file. The file needs to be renamed as map in the main folder and inside the GUI folder.

To execute program, run two instances of Matlab. One instance should run the gui and the other should run the simulink file.
